2. Download/Clone this repository. It is recommmended to CLONE the repo using a git client, because you may then diff againt master for any odd error you encounter. This is a good general practice.
3. Complete the projects as stated in the project rubrics. You should only need to clone once for the entire semester.

The issue will then be reviewed by the TA's for verification and eligibility for EC. Extra credit will only be given to those students who follow each of these steps.
